|**metadata** | [**ConfigurationMetadata**](ConfigurationMetadata.md) |  |  [optional] |
|**services** | [**List&lt;AzureSupportingService&gt;**](AzureSupportingService.md) | A list of Azure services to be monitored. Available services are listed by [/azure/supportedServices](https://dt-url.net/wt42sdq) operation.  For each service, a list of metrics and dimensions can be specified. A list of supported metrics and dimensions for a given service can be checked in [documentation](https://dt-url.net/kx2351b).  List of metrics can be skipped (set to null), resulting in recommended (default) set of metrics and dimensions being chosen for monitoring. For built-in services, adjusting the list of metrics is not supported, therefore it needs to be null. |  |
