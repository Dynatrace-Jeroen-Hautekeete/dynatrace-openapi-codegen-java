    Documentation of the Dynatrace Configuration API. To read about use-cases and examples, see [Dynatrace Documentation](https://dt-url.net/4u43kxw).

    Notes about compatibility:
    * Operations marked as early adopter or preview may be changed in non-compatible ways, although we try to avoid this.
    * We may add new enum constants without incrementing the API version; thus, clients need to handle unknown enum constants gracefully.
